# Problem 1.1.

we don't show the problem here because of the copyright issue. Please refer to the book "An Introduction to Manifolds" by Loring W. Tu.

## Answer

First of all, since the target of the function \(g\) is \(\mathbb{R}\), we should limit the domain of \(g\) to \(\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) because \(g(x)\) is not defined for negative \(x\).

By simple calculation, we have
\begin{align*}
  g'(x) &= \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{3} x^{1/3} = x^{1/3}, \\
  g''(x) &= \frac{1}{3} x^{-2/3}.
\end{align*}
So we have
\begin{align*}
  h'(x) &= \int _{0} ^{x} g(t)dt = \frac{3}{4} x^{4/3}, \\
  h''(x) &= \int _{0} ^{x} g'(t)dt = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} x^{1/3} = \frac{9}{16} x^{1/3}, \\
  h'''(x) &= \int _{0} ^{x} g''(t)dt = \frac{9}{16} \cdot \frac{3}{2} x^{1/3 - 2/3} = \frac{27}{32} x^{-1/3}.
\end{align*}
Thus, we have
\begin{align*}
  h'(0) &= 0, \\
  h''(0) &= 0, \\
  \lim _{x \to +0 }h'''(x) &= \infty.
\end{align*}
Therefore, \(h\) is \(C^2\) but not \(C^3\) at \(x=0\).
